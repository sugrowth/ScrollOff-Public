            <p>ScrollOff gives you two powerful tools for scheduled blocking: <strong>Quiet Hours</strong> and <strong>No-Go Zones</strong>. Both let you block apps during specific times, but they work in fundamentally different ways. Choosing the right one (or using both together) can make the difference between sustainable focus and constant frustration.</p>

            <h2>The Core Difference: Gentle vs Strict</h2>
            <p><strong>Quiet Hours</strong> are like asking a friend to hold your phone during a meeting. It is gentle, forgiving, and penalty free. You set a schedule, your apps get blocked during that time, and when the window ends, everything goes back to normal. No wallet deductions. No credit loss. Just a peaceful pause.</p>
            
            <p><strong>No-Go Zones</strong> are like locking your phone in a safe and throwing away the key until morning. It is strict, absolute, and unforgiving. During a No-Go Zone, there are zero peeks, zero exceptions, and zero ways out unless you pay for an emergency unlock token or completely disable the session (which also costs money).</p>

            <blockquote><p>Think of Quiet Hours as a gentle nudge and No-Go Zones as a hard boundary. One helps you focus without stress. The other forces you to commit completely.</p></blockquote>

            <h2>When to Use Quiet Hours</h2>
            <p>Quiet Hours shine when you need <strong>consistent, sustainable focus</strong> without the anxiety of strict rules. Here's when to reach for them:</p>

            <h3>Daily Work Blocks</h3>
            <p>Set a 9 AM to 5 PM Quiet Hours mode on weekdays. Your work apps stay accessible, distracting apps stay blocked, and when 5 PM hits, you get your time back without having "wasted" credits or feeling guilty about peeking. Perfect for maintaining work life balance without the mental overhead.</p>

            <h3>Sleep Protection (Without the Stress)</h3>
            <p>A 10 PM to 7 AM Quiet Hours mode blocks late night scrolling without punishing you if you genuinely need to check your phone for an emergency. Unlike No-Go Zones, you still have access to your settings and emergency contacts. You just can't mindlessly scroll Instagram at 2 AM.</p>

            <h3>Focus Sprints</h3>
            <p>Need 90 minutes of deep work? Create a custom Quiet Hours mode for exactly that window. No pressure, no penalties if life interrupts, just a clean boundary that helps you stay on track.</p>

            <h3>Multiple Daily Windows</h3>
            <p>You can create up to <strong>10 different Quiet Hours modes</strong>. One for morning focus (6 AM to 9 AM), one for work (9 AM to 5 PM), one for evening family time (6 PM to 9 PM), and one for sleep (10 PM to 7 AM). Stack them throughout your day and week to build a sustainable rhythm.</p>

            <h2>When to Use No-Go Zones</h2>
            <p>No-Go Zones are for when you need to <strong>burn the boats</strong>. Use them when gentle boundaries are not enough and you need absolute commitment.</p>

            <h3>Breaking Night Scrolling Addiction</h3>
            <p>If you keep breaking your sleep Quiet Hours by convincing yourself "just 5 more minutes," it is time for a No-Go Zone. Set it from midnight to 8 AM. No peeks. No excuses. No wallet to spend. Either you sleep, or you pay for an emergency unlock.</p>

            <h3>Exam Prep or Deep Work Sessions</h3>
            <p>When you have a paper due tomorrow or an exam in 6 hours, Quiet Hours might not be enough. A No-Go Zone forces you to either focus or face the consequences. It is uncomfortable, but that discomfort is exactly what helps you push through.</p>

            <h3>Breaking a Specific Trigger Pattern</h3>
            <p>Do you always scroll TikTok right after dinner? Set a 2 hour No-Go Zone from 7 PM to 9 PM. The absolute restriction helps you break the automatic behavior and build a new routine in its place.</p>

            <h3>Accountability for Yourself</h3>
            <p>Some people need the threat of real consequences to stay disciplined. If you know you will talk yourself out of Quiet Hours but would never pay $1.49 for an emergency unlock, No-Go Zones provide that accountability.</p>

            <h2>Using Both Together</h2>
            <p>Here's the thing: you do not have to choose. The most effective setup often uses <strong>both</strong> features in combination.</p>

            <h3>The Layered Defense Strategy</h3>
            <p>Use <strong>Quiet Hours for your daily structure</strong> (work hours, evening wind down, morning routine) and <strong>No-Go Zones for your weakest moments</strong> (late night, early morning, whenever you historically break your rules).</p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quiet Hours: Work mode</strong> from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays (gentle blocking during work)</li>
                <li><strong>Quiet Hours: Evening mode</strong> from 6 PM to 9 PM (protect family/personal time)</li>
                <li><strong>No-Go Zone: Sleep protection</strong> from midnight to 6 AM (absolute blocking when you are most vulnerable)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Quiet Hours handle your productive hours without stress. The No-Go Zone handles your danger zone when willpower is lowest.</p>

            <h2>Which One Should You Start With?</h2>
            <p>If you are new to scheduled blocking, <strong>start with Quiet Hours</strong>. It is gentler, more forgiving, and helps you build the habit without the pressure of absolute restriction. Once you have a rhythm and know your weak points, add a No-Go Zone for the times when you need the hard line.</p>

            <p>If you have tried everything and nothing works, if you keep breaking your own rules and talking yourself out of boundaries, <strong>go straight to No-Go Zones</strong>. The discomfort is the point. It forces you to confront your habits instead of negotiating with yourself.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p><strong>Quiet Hours</strong> are for building sustainable, stress free focus habits. <strong>No-Go Zones</strong> are for breaking addictions and forcing hard commitments. One is a gentle guide. The other is a strict enforcer.</p>

            <p>Most people benefit from both. Use Quiet Hours for structure. Use No-Go Zones for accountability. And remember: the best tool is the one you will actually use consistently.</p>
